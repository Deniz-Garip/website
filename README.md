        <h2 style="color: white; text-align: center; padding: 0 20px;">
            My name is Deniz Garip. I am 18 years old. I was born in Northern Cyprus, and now I live in the town of Pontypridd in Wales. I study Computer Science at the University of South Wales. I started software development during the coronavirus period. At that time, schools were closed, and one of my friends had started writing code. I thought, “Why shouldn’t I start too?” Since then, I have wanted to work with software.        </h2>

        <h2 style="color: white; text-align: center; padding: 0 20px;">
            I’m studying at the University of South Wales. It’s my first year and I’m a student. I’m taking programming and security courses. I spend most of my time working on my assessments and improving my English.

            In my daily life, when my friends and I go to the pub, we play billiards and darts. I’m good at billiards, but I’m still improving in darts. When I don’t go out, I like staying at home and playing games. My friends and I play online games together. In my country, I sometimes organise football matches, and I play as well. Normally, I play as a goalkeeper, but when we don’t have enough players, I sometimes play in defence.        </h2>

            I am learning C++ at school. I believe I will improve myself in C++ because it is a powerful and useful programming language. I also know a little bit of Python. I tried to learn it 2 or 3 years ago and made some small projects, but I have forgotten most of it now. I also learned a little C# during the coronavirus period because I wanted to make my own game, and I can use Unity a bit. I also worked as a 3D designer for a company for a short time, so I can use Blender as well.        </h2>

        At school, we have some projects. One of them was a group project where we had to prepare a presentation. The topic was “digital storytelling,” and our group made a presentation about AI—its code and its advantages.
        In our programming lectures, we also had small projects. I can briefly mention them below so you can read them.
        We also learned about encryption methods in Information Security, such as Caesar cipher and Vigenère cipher, and how to break them.</h2>

                In our programming class at school, we had small C++ assignments. We completed them, and I will now explain their topics to you.

                 Monthly Income Program:
                The program asks the user for their monthly income and calculates the results. The output includes basic pay, bonus, medical allowance, and the total amount.

                 Distance Traveled Project:
                In this program, we calculate the distance traveled by multiplying speed and time, and the program outputs the total distance.
